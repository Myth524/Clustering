Case Study: Applying Clustering Methods in a Retail Company
Introduction
In the retail sector, understanding customer characteristics and behaviors is crucial for developing effective marketing and sales strategies. This case study explores the application of clustering methods to segment the customer base of a retail company. The goal is to identify homogeneous groups of customers that can be targeted with personalized strategies, thereby optimizing marketing campaigns and improving customer satisfaction.

Methodology
To address this problem, various clustering methods are used to find the best way to segment customers into meaningful groups. The methods applied include:

K-means: A partition-based method that aims to divide data into a predefined number of groups, minimizing variance within each group.
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): A density-based method that identifies high-density groups and can handle noise in the data.
Agglomerative Method: A hierarchical approach that builds a hierarchy of groups through a process of merging the closest pairs of groups.
Results
In the retail context, segmenting customers into 24 groups might result in ineffective segmentation if not managed properly. In this case, grouping 17 customers into a single group may not be optimal. Instead, dividing customers into 11 groups using the agglomerative method provides a more manageable and practical solution.

Although the DBSCAN method shows the best Silhouette index, which measures the cohesion and separation of groups, the agglomerative method, which is the second-best, provides a segmentation with 11 groups. This number of groups is preferable for the retail context as it allows for clearer and more specific segmentation without overloading the analysis with an excessive number of segments.

Conclusion
The application of clustering methods in the retail context reveals that a more manageable and practical segmentation can be more beneficial than a more detailed but potentially ineffective segmentation. In this case, the agglomerative method with 11 groups offers a balanced solution that provides a deeper understanding of customer behavior and better implementation of personalized marketing strategies.
