# **Case Study: Applying Clustering Methods in a Retail Company**

## **Description**
This project focuses on implementing clustering algorithms to segment the customer base of a retail company, with the goal of optimizing marketing strategies and improving customer experience. By identifying meaningful customer groups, the company can develop personalized marketing campaigns that target specific needs and preferences, resulting in more effective engagement and higher conversion rates.

## **Key Features**
**Customer Segmentation:** Utilizes clustering methods like K-means, DBSCAN, and agglomerative clustering to divide customers into groups based on their behaviors and characteristics.
**Optimal Grouping:** After evaluating multiple methods, the project concludes that dividing the customers into 11 clusters, using the agglomerative method, yields the most effective segmentation for the retail context.
**Performance Metrics:** Measures the quality of the clustering solutions using indices like the Silhouette score to ensure cohesion and separation between groups.

## **Technologies Used**
**Python:** For data analysis and implementation of clustering algorithms.
**Scikit-learn:** A library used for applying clustering methods such as K-means, DBSCAN, and agglomerative clustering.
**Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and analysis.
**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Used for visualizing the clusters and performance metrics.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the power of clustering algorithms in retail by helping companies identify distinct customer groups. The results suggest that using 11 clusters provides a balanced approach to customer segmentation, making marketing efforts more targeted and efficient.
